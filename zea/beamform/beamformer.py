    """Time-of-flight (TOF) correction for ultrasound data on a flat pixel grid.

    Corrects raw RF or IQ data for differences in propagation time from the
    transmitter through each pixel and back to every receiving element.  Two
    modes are supported:

    * **Homogeneous medium** (default) — a constant ``sound_speed`` is used
      to compute delays analytically via :func:`calculate_delays`.
    * **Heterogeneous medium** — a spatially-varying speed-of-sound map
      (``sos_map``) is provided and delays are computed numerically via
      :func:`calculate_delays_heterogeneous_medium`.

    .. important::

       The heterogeneous mode currently requires **multistatic** acquisitions
       (``n_tx == n_el``).

    After delay computation the data is interpolated to the requested pixel
    positions, masked with the receive f-number aperture, and — for IQ data —
    phase-rotated to compensate for the demodulation carrier (see
    :func:`complex_rotate`).

    Args:
        data (Tensor): Input RF or IQ data of shape ``(n_tx, n_ax, n_el, n_ch)``.
            Use ``n_ch=1`` for RF data and ``n_ch=2`` for IQ (in-phase /
            quadrature).
        flatgrid (Tensor): Pixel locations ``(x, y, z)`` of shape ``(n_pix, 3)``.
        t0_delays (Tensor): Per-element transmit fire times, shifted so that
            the first element fires at *t = 0*, of shape ``(n_tx, n_el)``.
        tx_apodizations (Tensor): Transmit apodization weights of shape
            ``(n_tx, n_el)``.
        sound_speed (float): Speed of sound in m/s.
        probe_geometry (Tensor): Element positions ``(x, y, z)`` of shape
            ``(n_el, 3)``.
        initial_times (Tensor): Per-transmit time offsets of shape ``(n_tx,)``.
        sampling_frequency (float): Sampling frequency in Hz.
        demodulation_frequency (float): Demodulation (carrier) frequency in Hz.
            Only used when ``n_ch=2`` (IQ data).
        f_number (float): Receive f-number.  Set to ``0`` to disable
            f-number masking.
        polar_angles (Tensor): Steering angles in radians of shape ``(n_tx,)``.
        focus_distances (Tensor): Focus distances in meters of shape
            ``(n_tx,)``.  Use ``0`` or ``np.inf`` for plane-wave transmission.
        t_peak (Tensor): Time of each waveform peak in seconds of shape
            ``(n_waveforms,)``.
        tx_waveform_indices (Tensor): Index into ``t_peak`` for each transmit
            of shape ``(n_tx,)``.
        transmit_origins (Tensor): Origin of each transmit beam of shape
            ``(n_tx, 3)``.
        apply_lens_correction (bool, optional): Apply acoustic-lens correction
            to the receive travel times (slower but more accurate in the
            near-field).  Defaults to ``False``.
        lens_thickness (float, optional): Lens thickness in meters.
            Defaults to ``1e-3``.
        lens_sound_speed (float, optional): Speed of sound inside the lens in
            m/s.  Defaults to ``1000``.
        fnum_window_fn (callable, optional): Window function applied to the
            normalized angle for f-number masking.  Receives values in ``[0, 1]``
            and should return ``0`` for values ``> 1``.
            Defaults to :func:`fnum_window_fn_rect`.
        sos_map (Tensor, optional): 2-D speed-of-sound map of shape
            ``(Nz, Nx)`` in m/s.  When provided, delays are computed
            numerically (heterogeneous mode, multistatic only).
            Defaults to ``None``.
        sos_grid_x (Tensor, optional): x-coordinates of ``sos_map`` columns.
        sos_grid_z (Tensor, optional): z-coordinates of ``sos_map`` rows.

    compensated as well.  This function applies the rotation:

    .. math::

        I_\\Delta &= I' \\cos\\theta - Q' \\sin\\theta \\\\
        Q_\\Delta &= Q' \\cos\\theta + I' \\sin\\theta

    Args:
        iq (Tensor): IQ data of shape ``(..., 2)``.
        theta (Tensor or float): Rotation angle in radians (broadcastable to
            ``iq[..., 0]``).

    Returns:
        Tensor: Rotated IQ data of shape ``(..., 2)``.

    .. dropdown:: Derivation

        The IQ data is related to the RF data as follows:

        .. math::

            x(t) &= I(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t) + Q(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t + \\pi/2)\\\\
            &= I(t)\\cos(\\omega_c t) - Q(t)\\sin(\\omega_c t)


        If we want to delay the RF data `x(t)` by `Δt` we can substitute in
        :math:`t=t+\\Delta t`. We also define :math:`I'(t) = I(t + \\Delta t)`,
        :math:`Q'(t) = Q(t + \\Delta t)`, and :math:`\\theta=\\omega_c\\Delta t`.
        This gives us:

        .. math::

            x(t + \\Delta t) &= I'(t) \\cos(\\omega_c (t + \\Delta t))
            - Q'(t) \\sin(\\omega_c (t + \\Delta t))\\\\
            &=  \\overbrace{(I'(t)\\cos(\\theta)
            - Q'(t)\\sin(\\theta) )}^{I_\\Delta(t)} \\cos(\\omega_c t)\\\\
            &- \\overbrace{(Q'(t)\\cos(\\theta)
            + I'(t)\\sin(\\theta))}^{Q_\\Delta(t)} \\sin(\\omega_c t)

        This means that to correctly interpolate the IQ data to the new components
        :math:`I_\\Delta(t)` and :math:`Q_\\Delta(t)`, it is not sufficient to just
        interpolate the I- and Q-channels independently. We also need to rotate the
        I- and Q-channels by the angle :math:`\\theta`. This function performs this
        rotation.
